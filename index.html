                            Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within
                            the fields of information retrieval and natural language
                            processing (NLP), which is concerned with building systems

                            Different from search engines, a question answering system
                            will give direct answers to any natural language questions instead

                            Where does the answer come from? In this research, we built our QA
                            system based on knowledge bases. More specifically, we are using
                            Freebase as our major data source.
                            Freebase is a large collaborative knowledge base currently maintained by Google.
                            Essentially, Freebase is just a list of triples in the format of

                        Now, I want to give a quick demo about an interesting webapp built
                        upon our Question Answering system, in order to give you a clear notion
                        about the problem we are solving here.

                        From the demo, we can see that there are two major challeges. One is
                        the relation matching problem, which is how can find the relationship
                        that answers the question.

                        Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” –
                        are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.
                        The motivation for using LSTM is that LSTM has been proved to be quite
                        effective when solving machine translation problems, and matching relations
                        can be considered as a form of translation.
